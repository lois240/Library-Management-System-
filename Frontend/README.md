### How to Run

To run the frontend code, follow these simple steps:

1. **Open the File:** Navigate to the project directory and open the `Login.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
2. **Ensure Backend is Running:** The application requires a backend API for full functionality, specifically for user login and registration. Based on the provided code, the frontend attempts to communicate with a server at `http://localhost:8080/api` and `http://localhost:5000/api`. Make sure your backend server is running on the correct port to enable these features.
